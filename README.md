# 📚 AI Book Recommendation System

An NLP-based Book Recommendation System built using **Python, Streamlit, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec**. The system collects book data from an API, preprocesses textual information, generates text embeddings, and recommends books based on user preferences.

---

## Features

* Fetches book data from the Google Books API
* Performs complete NLP preprocessing pipeline
* Stores processed data in CSV format
* Supports two recommendation techniques:

  * TF-IDF
  * Word2Vec
* Interactive Streamlit interface
* Returns recommended books with similarity scores
* Compares keyword-based and embedding-based retrieval approaches

## Data Collection

Book metadata was collected using the **Google Books API**.

The following information was extracted:

* Book Title
* Authors
* Categories
* Description
* Published Date

After collection, the data was stored in a CSV file for further processing.

---

## NLP Preprocessing

The book descriptions were processed using a complete NLP pipeline:

* Lowercasing
* Removing punctuation
* Removing special characters
* Tokenization
* Stopword removal
* Lemmatization

The final cleaned text was stored in a new column called:

```text
processed_text
```

The processed dataset was then saved as:

```text
books_data.csv
```

## Text Representation

### TF-IDF

TF-IDF converts text into numerical vectors based on word importance.

Advantages:

* Fast
* Lightweight
* Easy to implement

Limitation:

* Relies on keyword matching
* Does not understand semantic meaning

Example:

```text
AI ≠ Artificial Intelligence
ML ≠ Machine Learning
```

---

### Word2Vec

Word2Vec generates dense word embeddings that capture semantic relationships between words.

Advantages:

* Better semantic understanding than TF-IDF
* Similar words have similar vector representations

Example:

```text
King ≈ Queen
AI ≈ Machine Learning
```

---

## Recommendation Engine

The recommendation system uses **Cosine Similarity** to compare user queries with book representations.

### TF-IDF Recommendation

```text
User Query
      ↓
TF-IDF Vector
      ↓
Cosine Similarity
      ↓
Top Matching Books
```

### Word2Vec Recommendation

```text
User Query
      ↓
Word2Vec Embedding
      ↓
Cosine Similarity
      ↓
Top Matching Books
```
